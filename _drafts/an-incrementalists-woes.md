Have you ever inventoried your Github repos? Let's take a look at mine and see if I'm 
a *Dreamer*, a *Doer* or an *Incrementalist*.

My friend has a home office where he runs his consulting business. In that office, he has a 
bookshelf full of books that he hasn't read yet, some of those books have been there
for years. He calls that bookshelf his
**Shrine to Good Intentions**.

I recently made a new repository to share with him a project I was working on, 
a game using the Entity-Component-System pattern. I suddenly realized that my own
**Shrine to Good Intentions** was 60 repos of half-baked software. That prompted me to 
inventory my repos to see if there was anything actually uasable in there.

I use Github organizations to group my software by my hobby interests. I have [AE0ZW](https://ae0zw.github.io) for my amatuer radio projects, [OpenCDSi](https://opencdsi.github.io) for the Worldvax immunization project,[Anso Designs](https://ansodesigns.github.io) for a landing page, and [Other](https://dennisdunn.github.io) for my blog. My first step was to do a count by organization.

- AE0ZW **11** repos
- OpenCDSi/Worldvax **17** repos
- Anso Designs **1** repo
- Other **29** repos

As I scanned these repos I realized that I could classify each repo by what I had
hoped to gain from that particular project. Those classes are:
- Public good - Open source/maybe of interest to others
- Commercial - Commercial projects
- Discovery - Projects to learn about some aspect of hw/sw.
- Dependencies - Projects to support other projects
- Conference talks - Projects to support my conference talks

Some repos could belong to more than one class.

All of the repos for OpenCDSi/Worldvax are in ```Public Good```, some of these are also in ```Discovery```. Anso Designs has the only ```Commercial``` project and the AE0ZW projects are
all ```Discovery```.

For the Other repos, we have:
- Public good **6** repos
- Discovery **13** repos
- Dependencies **2** repos
- Conference talks **12** repos
