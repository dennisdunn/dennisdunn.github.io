I'll be speaking at [Stir Trek](https://stirtrek.com/speakers/2024/Dennis-Dunn.html#abstract) this year 
on .NET MAUI and building an app for configuring a gizmo.

Last year I fat-fingered my submission during the *Call For Presentations* so nobody got to see my **Planespotting With Node-Red** talk. It would have been awesome!

This year, however, I managed to secure a slot with a talk on Android app development with *.NET MAUI*. I'll start with the gizmo and how to advertise a UART service over Bluetooth LE using MicroPython on a Raspberry Pico W. The second section of the talk will be about setting up Visual Studio 2022 for cross-platform development. The third part of the talk will cover developing the gizmo configuration app for Android.

Here are some resources if you would like to follow along while I work on the app and the presentation.
